  "summary": "Diff adds per-set target weights via a new `setWeights` array on exercises across backend types and multiple frontend components/utilities. However, it also introduces a migration module outside `backend/main.mo` and changes workout logging to per-set actual weights, which conflicts with stated constraints and non-goals. Evidence for updating backend canister methods (`createWorkout`, `getWorkoutsForClient`) is not visible in the provided truncated diff.",

      "reason": "Non-goal explicitly says: \"Do not change the workout logging model to collect per-set actual weights; keep the current single actualWeight input per exercise.\" Diff changes `ExerciseLog` to include `actualSetWeights` and frontend builds arrays of per-set weights when saving.",
